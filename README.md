# Multi-Link Trip Planner(Placeholder name)

## Description
AT’s Journey planner currently only calculates route and times for a single trip from A to B.
This website aims to string/link together multiple trips into one journey so that you can plan a trip from A to B to C. It should account for how long you plan to stay in between trips before moving on.

### MVP
- Be able to plan a journey with 3 locations linking at least 2 trips together.
- Describe how long the user plans to stay at the second location.
- Time/Date of bus arrivals.
- Displays map showing all trips.
#### Secondary
